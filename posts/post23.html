                    <p>

                        Lately, many people have asked me the question,"Does drinking coffee on a regular basis CAUSE
                        DEMENTIA?" Multiple studies are being published stating there is an ASSOCIATION with drinking
                        coffee and dementia, but none of those studies state there is a CAUSATION between coffee
                        drinking and dementia, which by the way association versus causation is the same false premise
                        constantly used to push the false Vitamin D deficiency syndrome scams.<br><br>

                        So once again basic science and common sense save us from tackling what could be at the heart of
                        our concern since 66% of Americans nowd rink coffee each day, more than any other beverage
                        including tap water and up by nearly 14% since January 202. Is Starbucks a dementia generating
                        business? Or could something else be the CAUSE not the ASSOCIATION of coffee consumption and
                        dementia? </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is the most obvious causation overlooked by all the studies I have seen thus far;<br><br>
                        If you had a good night's sleep, (3-4 cycles of NREM/REM) then why would you need a big cup or a
                        few cups of coffee to WAKE YOU UP in the morning?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What you need to understand and KNOW.
                        <br><br>Chronic insomnia and untreated sleep apnea, which is really chronic insomnia due to some
                        obstruction, (large tonsils, big throat and "obesity"), is why people need those 50 to 400+ mg
                        plus of caffeine per cup. (A big 16 oz Starbucks grande can contain over 300 mg of caffeine). to
                        wake them up in the morning. (Causation not association)
                        Chronic insomnia over time is the culprit which causes long term hypoxia, (lack of oxygen), and
                        when your brain constantly does not receive oxygen the frontal lobe, (FOR memory), The
                        hippocampus, (HIPPOS and Elephants have great memories), are starved of their major antioxidant,
                        defender against free radicals which is OXYGEN.
                        <br><br>
                        Secondly, what in the world is the best food for your brain cells? Which came first Oxygen or
                        the multiple brain supplements found on the market today? This is probably the one question
                        evolutionists and creationist could agree upon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hence over time you begin to forget because your brain has been starved of a vital food and
                        antioxidant called OXYGEN, disguised in the form of insomnia and masked by the WAKE ME UP BEFORE
                        YOU GO GO effect of coffee.
                        In a materialistic society where we are valued by our ability to live in a great home, drive a
                        luxury car and wear designer clothing, we work 9-5 and then 5-9 to obtain these things. The
                        introduction of stimulants in a juice known as coffee helps override the effects of our lifelong
                        battle with AM insomnia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        BTW keep in mind that if your brain does not go through 3-4 Non-rem/REM sleep cycles due to
                        insomnia you are not getting enough oxygen to your brain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Sleeping Pills" for the most part produce anesthesia and not sleep. If you ever had a medical
                        procedure under general anesthesia "loss of memory" is the major effect. You have no idea what
                        was
                        done to you. Also you have to be provided with , here it is OXYGEN when placed under general
                        anesthesia. I don't know of many people who take a sleeping pill and use supplemental Oxygen at
                        the
                        same time, or take a sleeping pill while hooked up to their C-pap or Bi-pap machine.
                        If you want a good night's sleep listen to my lecture "Rockabye baby why can't I sleep"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next year I will tackle the subject revenge of the hypothalamus. Initial weight loss per
                        surgical weight loss or obesity medications followed by rebound weight gain driven by your
                        hypothalamus. Why lifestyle changes is the only way to get it off slowly and keep it off. This
                        is why Lower6 is a program and not a surgery or medication. How many surgeries can one have in
                        the same area and what happens after you stop taking that pill?
