                    <p>
                        The Egyptians B.C constructed pyramid structures that not only stand today, but still baffle the
                        mind as to the genius and creativity that built them.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dr. James was one of the most interesting professors during the academic years of my training.
                        In his class you were given 2 oral exams the whole semester then he gave you a grade. The first
                        oral exam Dr. James asked you just one question and then listened to your answer. For the second
                        oral exam however, he gave you the answer to a question and then asked you to explain why was
                        that the answer to the question? Dr. James told his students, "I am not looking for the right
                        answer, but I am listening to the way you THINK". He continued by saying, "Multiple choice exams
                        are culturally biased, created for good test takers and support the multi-million dollar test
                        preparation industry."</p>
                    <p>Here is a culturally biased I.Q. test question designed to trick the Limbic and Hypothalamus lobes
                        of the mind;</p>
                    <p><strong>Which PHRASEOLOGY best describes the meaning of the picture below?</strong></p>

                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/egypt1.jpg" alt="laboratory" /></a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Photo by Dr. Colin Ross</span>

                    <p>
                        A) White like snow. <br>
                        B) FL for Fluoride not Florida.<br>
                        C) I get around.<br>
                        D) 2 for the price of one <br>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The answer is C. "I get around" which was a song, (Phraseology), written by Rap artist Tu Pak
                        Shakur. The coloring around the word "2 pack" will help the limbic/hypothalamic lobes of a
                        person familiar with rap culture feel and then guess that "I get around" is the right answer.
                        But even if you knew that the word Phraseology just means music, a mind devoid of an experience
                        with rap music would pick answer A. "White like snow" is a song.
                        Many people are not aware that Behavioral learning psychologists work for the standardized test
                        writing and standardized test preparation INDUSTRIES.
                    </p>
                    <!-- first pic -->
                    <!-- <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/diet-1.jpg" alt="laboratory" /></a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Photo by Rhys Kentish on Unsplash</span> -->

                    <p>
                        The Psychologist gets test questions written by a test writer and then will rearrange the test
                        question to culturally/psychologically trick the mind of the test taker into picking the wrong
                        answer.
                    </p>

                    <p> TEST preparation psychologists however will unravel the cultural bias and psychological tricks
                        played on the mind so that a 1.6 billion dollar test preparation industry teaches students how
                        to pass exams but not master material.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hence, many clinicians today for example, would not know how to use a simple stethoscope to
                        differentiate a left sided versus a right sided heart murmur because real live patients either
                        breathe in or out but do not present to the office with multiple choice options written on their
                        chest.
                        This is why Dr. James either asked you a question or asked why this was the right answer to a
                        question because dissertations great or small produce creative thinking scholars.</p>

                    <p>At Teaching The World International Inc. we encourage students to take test preparation courses to
                        pass any standardized exams, but we have created a research based program to help students
                        answer questions or find the reason for the right answer by MASTERING material in their learning
                        style.
                        The only way one builds anything that will withstand the test of time is by thinking like an
                        Egyptian B.C.</p>
